                Have you ever created modern web applications and hoped that HTML and CSS would be little
                more flexible? Well, I havent. I have lost hope a long time ago and accepted the truth that 
                they are completely unsuitable for creating complex UI's and really can't be improved that much
                without fundamental changes. We have been reduced to creating applications using what is
                essentially a text markup language. I am not the only one who thinks this way, you can read some insights 
                about these technologies below.

                Forget the HTML and CSS if you are doing complex applications instead of traditional web pages. There is no need to construct
                new applications using archaic technologies that have evolved like the animals at the Chernobyl. As their original functions
                and purpose were lost long time ago they are now a grotesque freak show, abused and dysfunctional, only useful to
                serve as warning of man's folly.
                
                <p>
                It's time to leave that stuff behind and use something that can be actually used to build UI's instead of hacking and
                twisting HTML and CSS to fit your purposes. With Canvas and WebGL it is possible to build UI sytems
                completely inside the browser. Forget cross-broser incompabilities, pixel-perfect UI's are here and they are here to stay!

                    do anything you like and every browser will support it immediately.
